This simplistic site is temporary while we work on the main one.<br /><br />
Lab 1  
<br />
Here’s some brief information about the position: 

<p>
Summary of Research: 
Seed dispersal, the process of moving seeds away from their parent tree, is important to ensure that seedlings survive. In the tropics, seed dispersal by animals is the primary means by which trees are able to disseminate seeds. The study location is located in the Bilsa Biological Station located in the Choco tropical dry forests of Ecuador. The Choco is a highly threatened system, with only 10% of its original range remaining. In this system, seed dispersal keeps genetic diversity high and facilitates regeneration of the forest. We have placed camera traps on a large palm species, both at the base of the tree as well as in its canopy where bunches of hundreds of large, single-seeded fruits appear. We hope to capture footage of animals eating and/or moving fruit to quantify the rate of seed dispersal itself and conduct statistical analyses to complement other data we have collected in the past.

Responsibilities

<p>
The basic workflow is pretty simple. I will conduct a training session so that the undergrad knows what the specific protocol is for processing videos. The videos will be available via OneDrive, so the student can do the work anywhere there is an internet connection. Videos are about 30 seconds to a minute long, and contain footage taken by a camera trap on site. The student will identify any animals present in the videos, as well as record important behaviors seen.
Time commitment
I expect each undergrad to invest 4 hours a week processing videos. Because access will be decentralized, they can work at their own schedule.

Lab 2 
<br />
Here’s some brief Information about the position: 

<p>
I study plant and microbial ecology and I currently have a project investigating how global change is influencing plant-microbe interactions in an invasive wetland plant. 
I am currently looking for an assistant for the rest of the school year (a volunteer or someone who wants independent study credit or potentially work study) to help with laboratory work such as DNA extractions, PCR, microbial culturing, and soil biogeochemical processing. I am also looking for someone over the summer to help with lab work as well as help with a greenhouse experiment and a field experiment manipulating plants and salinity in a local marsh (this would be an hourly paid position).
For the school year, I would want a commitment of 6 (or more!) hrs per week. For the summer, half-time (20 hrs per week) or full-time (40 hrs) would be great for about two months.
As for skills, prior molecular training (dna extraction, pcr) is nice but not essential, anyone with attention to detail who is interesting in learning lab work would be fine, we can train them in our protocols. Being willing to work in very hot and wet and dirty field conditions (marshes and the greenhouse) is important too (again previous field experience is a plus, but not required).

Database Management at Department of Global Biostatistics and Data Science
<br />
Here’s some brief Information about the position: 
<p>
Summary of Research
You will be working under the PI of the Louisiana Osteoporosis Study, which aims to recruit 20,000 human subjects to build a large sample pool and database for the research of identifying risk factors important for osteoporosis and related health problems.
Dr. Zhao’s primary research interests focus on identifying and characterizing genetic variants that affecting susceptibility to complex human disorders, such as osteoporosis, obesity, and osteoporotic fracture. She has extensive experience in molecular genetics, bioinformatics, genetic epidemiology and bone biology, teaches database management and bioinformatics and genomics courses, and is a reviewer for a multitude of scientific journals.
</p>
Responsibilities <br />
You will be expected to learn to manage and maintain a large database.<br />
Time Commitment<br />
At least a year, with at least 10 hours per week<br />
Skills desired<br />

Department of Global Biostatistics and Data Science (Downtown Campus)<br />

<p>
Currently, they have an immediate need for computer science (CS) majors on their clinical side to help build a survey database with thousands of samples. This is a very large endeavor and is critical for their operation, and will look really good on your resume. 
</p>
<p>
They also need an unspecified number of students with general science interests for wet lab, Data Analytics/Mathematics/CS for dry lab, PreMed/PreDent/Public Health for survey and clinical data collection, and Marketing majors for marketing surveys to Louisiana residents.
</p>

Lab 3<br />

Field of Research:  Global Environmental Health Sciences (GEHS), Public Health<br />

Brief Description of Research:<br />
<p>
Water contaminated with feces impacts human health by introducing enteric pathogenic organisms. Recreational waters, oyster/shellfish farms, beaches, and drinking waters may be compromised by faulty sewage systems, dysfunctional septic tanks, agricultural runoff, and wildlife. We are trying to find better ways to determine the source(s) of fecal contamination in coastal Louisiana. We are also developing new molecular methods for rapid detection of waterborne pathogens such as Legionella and Norovirus.
Brief Description of Lab Position:
This position will assist graduate students in media preparation, molecular analysis, sample collection etc. After few months of training, he/she will have her own independent project in water quality related research. 
</p>
Skills Required:<br />
Good oral and written skills, basic science and math concepts, knowledge of water quality and public health.<br />
Skills Preferred:<br />
Experience in lab work.<br />
Expected Weekly Time Commitment:<br />
20-30 hours<br />
Long-Term Time Commitment:<br />
1-2 years<br />

Gragert Lab<br />
Summary of Research:<br />
<p>
The Gragert Lab works to improve systems for matching donors with recipients for transplantation. We focus on population genetics analysis of HLA, the compatibility genes for transplantation. The research involves analyzing HLA polymorphisms in populations and building tools that directly inform clinical decision making in transplantation. We work directly with the nonprofit organizations that run the national registries that facilitate transplants. For bone marrow and cord blood transplantation, we work with National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) / Be The Match to improve their matching algorithm, HapLogic. For kidney transplantation, we work with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to improve the deceased donor kidney allocation system. 
</p>

Skills Desired:<br />
<p>
We are seeking undergraduates who are interested in the areas of bioinformatics, immunology, population genetics, math, statistics, and/or computer science. Having a high level of Interest, enthusiasm, and commitment are more important than the skills you already have. Therefore, all experience levels are encouraged to apply!  We are an all-computational lab, so our work is done at the computer, rather than at the bench. You’ll primarily be working with large population datasets of DNA typing of HLA genes. Depending on your interests, you could be working on projects involving Python programming, statistical analysis using R, web frameworks with Python Django, graph databases in Neo4j, and/or Unix scripting. There may also be opportunities to work with the Tulane Cancer Center’s Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analysis Core.
</p>
Time Commitment:<br />
We expect a minimum of 15 hours a week in the lab for undergraduates during the school year and full time during the summer.
